# Project-Lionheart
An Artificial Intelligence program made to predict exercise induced angina using Python and TensorFlow.

***This project was created amidst the Covid-19 pandemic****

Given the current pandemic, many have remained at home. Lockdowns have generally been very detrimental to people's ability to exercise, nevermind going to the gym. 
With the vaccine ushering in hopes of gyms and workout classes opening up, one particular condition may see a resurgence.
 Angina is a serious heart condition that causes severe chest pain, and is often indicative of blockages in the arteries of the heart- which is already deeply accentuated by prolonged periods of inactivity. 
The reason angina is so serious is that it may possibly be a precursor to heart attacks, or even heart failure.
 The elderly have higher risks of dying from heart complications, and studies have shown they have remained home the most. 
Going into our first hackathon, Dorian Knight and I had this particular idea in mind. 
Thus for MLH’s first hackathon of the year-New Years New Hacks- we created an artificial intelligence program that is able to predict the chance of exercise induced angina with an astounding 80% accuracy using Google’s TensorFlow. 
This accuracy rivals that of new methods for similar conditions, yet does not require any invasive tests. In fact, it does not even require age! The latter was a conscious choice, made to ensure the confidentiality of those being tested. 
It was a pleasure diving into the technical world of AI!
